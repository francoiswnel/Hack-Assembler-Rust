# Hack Assembler in Rust

`rhasm` is an assembler for the Hack language implemented in Rust, ported from my [C++ implementation](https://github.com/francoiswnel/Hack-Assembler).

Status: Work in progress. I am in the process of learning Rust so I have no idea what I'm doing, but that's half the fun.
